Main idea of JS:

- Save the data
- Generate the HTML
- Make it interactive

Get a variable out of a file:

- Modules are used to avoid naming conflicts (Module only can be used with Live server)
- Add type="module" attribute
- export
- import

Deduplicating or Normalizing the data

- By using a product ID pulling other information is one of the example of this technique.

MVC = Model - View - Controller : It's a design pattern
\*MVC always makes sure the page always matches the data

- Update the data.
- Regenerate all the HTML
  In MVC we split the code into 3 parts
- Model: saves and manages the data, like - Data folder.
- View: Takes the data and displays into the page, like - checkout.js
- Controller: Run some code when we interact with the page, like - Event Listeners
