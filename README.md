Main idea of JS:

- Save the data
- Generate the HTML
- Make it interactive

Get a variable out of a file:

- Modules are used to avoid naming conflicts (Module only can be used with Live server)
- Add type="module" attribute
- export
- import

Deduplicating or Normalizing the data

- By using a product ID pulling other information is one of the example of this technique.
